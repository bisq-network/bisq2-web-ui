# Keep display strings organized by domain
# Naming convention: We use camelCase and dot separated name spaces.
# Use as many sub spaces as required to make the structure clear, but as little as possible.
# E.g.: [main-view].[component].[description]
# In some cases we use enum values or constants to map to display strings. Those cannot be detected by IDE and 
# might show incorrectly as unused.

# An annoying issue with property files is that we need to use 2 single quotes in display string
# containing variables (e.g. {0}), otherwise the variable will not be resolved.
# In display string which do not use a variable a single quote is ok.
# E.g. Don''t .... {1}

# Hyperlinks in popups can be added via: [HYPERLINK:https://....]. They will get displayed as enumerated footer notes.

# We use sometimes dynamic parts which are put together in the code and therefore sometimes use line breaks or spaces
# at the end of the string. Please never remove any line breaks or spaces.
# To make longer strings better readable you can make a line break with \ which does not result in a line break
# in the string, only in the editor.

# Please use in all language files the exact same order of the entries, that way comparison is easier.

# Please try to keep the length of the translated string similar to English. If it is longer it might break layout or
# get truncated. We will need some adjustments in the UI code to support that, but we want to keep effort at the minimum.

tradeGuide.tab1.headline=Security
tradeGuide.tab1.content=\
  - The security model of Bisq Easy is suited only for rather small trade amounts\n\
  - It is based on the reputation of the seller\n\
  - The seller is usually an experienced Bisq user and is expected to be helpful and supportive for users who are new to Bitcoin and Bisq.\n\
  - Building up reputation can cause costs. A price premium of about 10-15% is common to reflect those extra costs and to compensate for the onboarding service the seller provides.\n\
  - By default, private messages are only accessible to sellers with a certain level of reputation, but users can opt-out from that protection.\n\
  - Trading with sellers without reputation carries significant risks and should be only done if the risks are well understood and managed.

tradeGuide.tab2.headline=Trade process
tradeGuide.tab2.content=\
  - The offer maker defines the trade terms, if this was not already defined in the maker's user profile.\n\
  - Once the traders have agreed on the trade terms (e.g. payment method and trade price) the trade starts.\n\
  - The seller transmits the payment account details to the buyer (e.g. bank account number). The buyer sends the BTC address to the seller.\n\
  - The buyer starts the Fiat payment to the sellers account and sends the seller a message that the payment is in transit.\n\
  - Once the seller has received the Fiat payment they send the Bitcoin to the buyers address.\n\
  - After the buyer received the Bitcoin the trade is completed.

tradeGuide.tab3.headline=Trade rules
tradeGuide.tab3.content=\
  - Before the payment details are exchanged the trade can be canceled by any party without justification.\n\
  - After the payment details are exchanged not fulfilling the trade obligations is considered a breach of the trade contract and can lead to getting banned from the network.\n\
  - When sending the Fiat the buyer MUST NOT use any term in the 'reason for payment' field which relates to 'Bisq' or 'Bitcoin'. The traders can agree on an identifier to associate the bank transfer to the trade (e.g. use some random string like 'H3TJAPD').\n\
  - If the trade cannot be completed instantly because the Fiat transfer takes longer, both traders have to be online at least once a day to follow up the trade process.\n\
  - If there are any open questions or problems the traders can use the support chat, invite a mediator into their trade chat or get in touch with Bisq support team on the Matrix channel at 'https://bisq.chat'.

reputation.headline=How to build up reputation
reputation.info=For Bitcoin sellers it is important to provide reputation to the buyer, because the buyer will send \
  the fiat amount first and need a reason why they should trust the seller.\n\
  Gaining reputation is intended for experienced Bisq users who are familiar with the Bisq DAO and BSQ.\n\n\
  There are multiple options how to provide reputation:\n\n\
  1. Burning BSQ\n\
  2. Setting up a BSQ bond\n\
  3. Importing the account age from a Bisq 1 account\n\
  4. Importing the signed account age witness from a Bisq 1 account

reputation.burnedBsq.tab2=Score
reputation.burnedBsq.tab3=How-to
reputation.burnedBsq.infoHeadline=Skin in the game
reputation.burnedBsq.info=By burning BSQ you provide evidence that you invested money into your reputation.\n\
  The burn BSQ transaction contains the hash of the public key of your profile. \
  In case of malicious behaviour your profile might get banned by mediators and with that your investment into your reputation would become worthless.
reputation.burnedBsq.infoHeadline2=What is the recommended amount to burn?
reputation.burnedBsq.info2=It will be determined by the competition of sellers. The sellers with the highest reputation score will have better \
  trade opportunities and can get a higher price premium. The top 3 offers ranked by reputation will get promoted in the 'Buy Bitcoin' screen.\n\n\
  Amounts below 20 BSQ might not provide the minimum level of security required to build up trust with a buyer (but it also depends on the market and traded amounts).\n\n\
  If burning BSQ is too much of a financial burden, consider the other available options for building up reputation.
reputation.burnedBsq.score.headline=Impact on reputation score
reputation.burnedBsq.score.info=Burning BSQ is considered the strongest form of reputation which is represented by the high weight factor. \
  The burned BSQ linearly decays to zero over a period of 30 days. \
  Periodical burning of smaller amounts represents a continuous long term engagement.\n\n\
  The reputation score is calculated as follows:

reputation.burnedBsq.score=Burned BSQ amount * decay factor
reputation.burnedBsq.ageScore=Amount * age in days
reputation.burnedBsq.totalScore=Score * weight + age score

reputation.burnedBsq.howToHeadline=Process for burning BSQ
reputation.burnedBsq.howTo=1. Select the user profile for which you want to attach the reputation.\n\
  2. Copy the 'profile ID'\n\
  3. Open Bisq 1 and go to 'DAO/PROOF OF BURN' and paste the copied value into the 'pre-image' field.\n\     \
  Enter the amount of BSQ you want to burn.\n\
  4. Publish the Burn BSQ transaction.\n\
  5. After blockchain confirmation your reputation will become visible in your profile.


reputation.bond=BSQ bonds
reputation.bond.tab1=Why
reputation.bond.tab2=Score
reputation.bond.tab3=How-to
reputation.bond.infoHeadline=Skin in the game
reputation.bond.info=By setting up a BSQ bond you provide evidence that you locked up money for gaining reputation.\n\
  The BSQ bond transaction contains the hash of the public key of your profile. \
  In case of malicious behaviour your bond could get confiscated by DAO voting and your profile might get banned by mediators.
reputation.bond.infoHeadline2=What is the recommended amount and lock time?
reputation.bond.info2=The lock time need to be at least 10000 blocks which is about 70 days to be considered a valid bond. \
  The amount can be chosen by the user and will determine together with the lock time the ranking to other sellers. \
  The sellers with the highest reputation score will have better \
  trade opportunities and can get a higher price premium. The top 3 offers ranked by reputation will get promoted in the 'Buy Bitcoin' screen.\n\n\
  Amounts below 1000 BSQ might not provide the minimum level of security required to build up trust with a buyer (but it also depends on the market and traded amounts).\n\n\
  If a BSQ bond is too much of a financial burden, consider the other available options for building up reputation.
reputation.bond.score.headline=Impact on reputation score
reputation.bond.score.info=Setting up a BSQ bond is considered a strong form of reputation which is represented by the high weight factor. \
  Min lock time: 10000 blocks (about 70 days)\n\n\
  The reputation score is calculated as follows:

reputation.bond.score=Bonded BSQ amount * lock time / 10000
reputation.bond.ageScore=Score * age in days
reputation.bond.totalScore=Score * weight + age score

reputation.bond.howToHeadline=Process for setting up a BSQ bond
reputation.bond.howTo=1. Select the user profile for which you want to attach the reputation.\n\
  2. Copy the 'profile ID'\n\
  3. Open Bisq 1 and go to 'DAO/BONDING/BONDED REPUTATION' and paste the copied value into the 'salt' field.\n\     \
  Enter the amount of BSQ you want to lock up and the lock time (min. 10000 blocks).\n\
  4. Publish the lockup transaction.\n\
  5. After blockchain confirmation your reputation will become visible in your profile.

reputation.accountAge.tab3=How-to
reputation.accountAge.infoHeadline=Provide trust
reputation.accountAge.info=By linking your Bisq 1 'account age' you can provide some level of trust.\n\n\
  There are some reasonable expectations that a user who has used Bisq for some time is an honest user. But of course \
  that expectation is rather weak compared to other forms of reputation where the user provides more "skin in the game" with \
  allocation of some financial resources.
reputation.accountAge.infoHeadline2=Privacy implications
reputation.accountAge.info2=Linking your Bisq 1 account with Bisq 2 has some implications on your privacy. \
  For verifying your 'account age' your Bisq 1 identity gets cryptographically linked to your Bisq 2 profile ID.\n\
  Though, the exposure is limited to the 'Bisq 1 bridge node' which is operated by a Bisq contributor who has set up a \
  BSQ bond (bonded role).\n\n\
  Account age is an alternative for those who do not want to use burned BSQ or BSQ bonds due to the financial \
  burden. The 'account age' should be at least several months to reflecting some level of trust.
reputation.accountAge.score.headline=Impact on reputation score
reputation.accountAge.score.info=Importing 'account age' is considered a rather weak form of reputation which is \
  represented by the low weight factor.\n\
  There is a cap of 1 year for the score calculation.\n\n\
  The reputation score is calculated as follows:

reputation.accountAge.totalScore=Account age in days (max. 365) * weight

reputation.accountAge.howToHeadline=Process for importing your 'account age' from Bisq 1
reputation.accountAge.howTo=1. Select the user profile for which you want to attach the reputation.\n\
  2. Copy the 'profile ID'\n\
  3. Open Bisq 1 and go to 'ACCOUNT/NATIONAL CURRENCY ACCOUNTS'. Select your oldest account and click the 'EXPORT ACCOUNT AGE' button. \
  This will create a signature with the given data and copies the result to the clipboard.\n\
  4. Go back to Bisq 2 and click the 'Request authorization' button. This sends the data to the 'Bisq 1 bridge node' for verification and publishing.\n\
  5. After a short delay your 'account age' should be visible in your reputation score.

reputation.signedWitness=Signed account age witness

reputation.signedWitness.tab3=How-to
reputation.signedWitness.infoHeadline=Provide trust
reputation.signedWitness.info=By linking your Bisq 1 'signed account age witness' you can provide some level of trust.\n\n\
  There are some reasonable expectations that a user who has traded a while back on Bisq 1 and got signed their account is an honest user. But of course \
  that expectation is rather weak compared to other forms of reputation where the user provides more "skin in the game" with \
  allocation of some financial resources. 
reputation.signedWitness.infoHeadline2=Privacy implications
reputation.signedWitness.info2=Linking your Bisq 1 account with Bisq 2 has some implications on your privacy. \
  For verifying your 'signed account age witness' your Bisq 1 identity gets cryptographically linked to your Bisq 2 profile ID.\n\
  Though, the exposure is limited to the 'Bisq 1 bridge node' which is operated by a Bisq contributor who has set up a \
  BSQ bond (bonded role).\n\n\
  Signed account age witness is an alternative for those who do not want to use burned BSQ or BSQ bonds due to the financial \
  burden. The 'signed account age witness' has to be at least 61 days old to be considered for reputation.
reputation.signedWitness.score.headline=Impact on reputation score
reputation.signedWitness.score.info=Importing 'signed account age witness' is considered not a very strong form of reputation which is represented by the weight factor. The 'signed account age witness' has to be at least 61 days old and there is a cap of 1 year for the score calculation. \n\n\
  The reputation score is calculated as follows:

reputation.signedWitness.totalScore=Witness age in days (min. 61, max. 365) * weight

reputation.signedWitness.howToHeadline=Process for importing your 'signed account age witness' from Bisq 1
reputation.signedWitness.howTo=1. Select the user profile for which you want to attach the reputation.\n\
  2. Copy the 'profile ID'\n\
  3. Open Bisq 1 and go to 'ACCOUNT/NATIONAL CURRENCY ACCOUNTS'. Select your oldest signed account and click the 'EXPORT SIGNED WITNESS' button. \
  This will create a signature with the given data and copies the result to the clipboard.\n\
  4. Go back to Bisq 2 and click the 'Request authorization' button. This sends the data to the 'Bisq 1 bridge node' for verification and publishing.\n\
  5. After a short delay your 'signed account age witness' should be visible in your reputation score.
